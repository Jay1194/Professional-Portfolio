# Professional-Portfolio

## Description
The goal of this project is to create a visually appealing and user-friendly portfolio website that showcases my previous work
for my future employers. This webpage was made from scratch keeping in mind the layout that includes sections for the my name,
and navigation links as well as prevoius work and information about me. This application also implements flexbox, media queries,
and CSS variables. This includes a responsive layout using CSS media queries to adapt the website's design and structure to different 
viewport sizes and devices.
